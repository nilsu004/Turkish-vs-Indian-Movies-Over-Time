# The Lipstick Effect on the Big Screen
Analyzing the Correlation Between Economic Indicators and Popular Media Genres

## Project Overview
This research project investigates the relationship between macroeconomic instability in some selected countries and shifts in consumer preferences within the entertainment industry. Specifically, it aims to determine whether negative economic indicators—such as rising unemployment rates, high inflation with a spike in popularity for "escapist" genres (e.g., , Comedy) in movies and television series.

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this research is to understand how macroeconomic instability influences the psychological needs of the people, as reflected in their entertainment choices. Specifically, this project aims to test the validity of the 'Lipstick Effect' in the entertainment industry. In economics, the Lipstick Effect is the theory that during recessions, consumers will still buy expensive goods, but they switch to smaller, affordable luxuries (like premium lipstick) rather than large purchases (like cars or houses).

In this context, a movie ticket or a streaming subscription represents that 'affordable luxury.' This study seeks to understand if economic distress drives a shift toward 'Escapist' genres as a coping mechanism, or if audiences prefer 'Realist' or darker genres (Horror, Drama) that mirror their societal anxiety.

## Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H0):  There is no significant correlation between economic downturns (indicated by unemployment rates, inflation, or GDP decline) and the popularity of escapist media genres.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):  There is a positive correlation between economic downturns and the popularity of escapist media genres. 


Selected Countries:
1. Turkey : Turkey is selected because it represents a high-inflation economy with strong fluctuations in recent years.
2. Italy: Italy is specifically selected to represent an economy currently experiencing a disinflationary trend (decreasing inflation) following the post-pandemic peak. Unlike Turkey, Italy’s recent economic data indicates a stabilization period. This inclusion is crucial for testing the reverse hypothesis: Does a decrease in economic pressure correlate with a decline in escapist media consumption and a return to realistic genres?
   
## Data Collecting
Temporal Scope: The timeframe spans from 2023 to  2025, segmented into semi-annual intervals (Jan-Jun and Jul-Dec) to capture short-term trends.

Media Data: Top-ranked Netflix content (Movies & TV Series) was collected for each interval and categorized by genre to identify 'Escapist' vs. 'Realist' trends.
(a website called FlixPatrol has the data for the most watched movies and tv series)

Economic Data: Inflation and Unemployment rates were gathered for the corresponding six-month periods for all selected countries.
